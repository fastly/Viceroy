## Unreleased

- Add support for supplying client certificates in fastly.toml, through the use of the
  `client_cert_info` table, which must have one of a "certificate" or "certificate_file"
  key, as well as one of a "key" and "key_file" key. The "_file" variants can be used to
  point to certificate/key files on disk, whereas the non-"_file" variants should be
  multi-line string constants in the toml. In all cases, they should be in PEM format.
