# Releasing Viceroy

Below are the steps needed to do a Viceroy release:

1. Make sure the Viceroy version has been bumped up to the current release
   version. You might need to bump the minor version (e.g. 0.2.0 to 0.3.0) if
   there are any semver breaking changes. Review the changes since the last
   release just to be sure.
1. Update the `Cargo.lock` files by running `make generate-lockfile`.
1. Update `CHANGELOG.md` so that it contains all of the updates since the
   previous version as its own commit. Remove the "## Unreleased" header.
1. Create a local branch in the form `release-x.y.z` where `x`, `y`, and `z` are
   the major, minor, and patch versions of Viceroy and have the tip of the
   branch contain the Changelog commit.
1. Run `make ci` locally to make sure that everything will pass before pushing
   the branch and opening up a PR.
1. After you get approval, run `git tag vx.y.z HEAD && git push origin --tags`.
   Pushing this tag will kick off a build for all of the release artifacts.
1. After CI completes, we should publish each crate in the workspace to the
   crates.io registry. Note that we must do this in order of dependencies. So,
  1. `(cd lib && cargo publish)`
  1. `(cd cli && cargo publish)`
1. Now, we should return to our release PR.
  1. Update the version fields in `lib/Cargo.toml` and `cli/Cargo.toml` to the
     next patch version (so `z + 1`).
  1. Update the dependency on `viceroy-lib` in `cli/Cargo.toml` to the next
     patch version.
  1. Update all the lockfiles by running `make generate-lockfile`.
  1. Restore the `## Unreleased` header at the top of `CHANGELOG.md`.
1. Get another approval and merge when CI passes.
